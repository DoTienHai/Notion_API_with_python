Notion_API_with_python is a Python-based project designed to interface with the Notion API, enabling the extraction, processing and synthesis of data stored in Notion. The core goal is to automate retrieval of structured information — such as pages, databases and custom properties — and then transform that data into actionable reports, spreadsheets or other formats. With modules to fetch JSON from Notion, convert it into Excel spreadsheets, generate customised personal or organisational summaries, and integrate updates dynamically, this tool supports both individual usage and company workflows. Built with Python and driven by real-world data requirements, this repository offers a practical playground for API consumption, data transformation, and desktop/automation scripting. Whether you're building internal dashboards, generating payroll or KPI reports, or simply learning how to work with APIs and data pipelines, this project combines functional purpose with educational value.
